\textbf{Objective:} In this first of three reports, the object is to apply methods learned in the first 4 weeks in the DTU course \textit{02450 Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining}. The tools focus on feature extraction and visualization, and this report should give a basic understanding of our data set. The subsequent reports 2 and 3 will deal with further analysis of the data.

\textbf{Material and tools:} The terms and notations used correspond to the notation in the course note \cite{coursenotes}, and we make use of scripts provided by the 02450Toolbox for Python 3.
